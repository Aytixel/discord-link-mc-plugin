Spigot plugin, plus an application, intended to be an equivalent to MumbleLink

# Install App
https://github.com/Aytixel/discord-link-mc

# Install Plugin
1. Download the corresponding version for your server : https://github.com/Aytixel/discord-link-mc-plugin/releases
2. Place it in your plugin folder, and run the server once to generate config files
3. Now change settings as you want in the config file
4. And make sure the port for the plugin is open and not the same as the server
5. Now all you have to do is give the address and port of the plugin to your players for them to connect

**With this plugin do not reload the server otherwise the plugin will crash.**

# Version
If you want a specific **version** you just have to **clone the repo** and **build it with the spigot version you want.**
I haven't tested it but the plugin should be compatible with many versions of spigot with little or no change.
